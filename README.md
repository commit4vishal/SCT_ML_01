This task focused on building a predictive model to estimate house prices using a variety of features from the Ames Housing Dataset — a clean, real-world dataset that gave me my first serious taste of how machine learning is applied in actual business cases.
🔍 Objective:
 Predict the sale price of houses based on features like lot area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, year built, and more using Linear Regression.
🛠️ Here’s what I worked on:
> Performed data exploration to understand feature relationships and price impact
> Selected relevant columns from the dataset to serve as predictors (LotArea, BedroomAbvGr, FullBath, YearBuilt, etc.)
> Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values and ensure consistency
> Implemented a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
> Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to quantify prediction error
> Generated predictions for the test dataset and formatted them for submission
> Uploaded everything to GitHub, including code, sample submission, and documentation
🧠 What I learned:
> The fundamentals of regression-based prediction and how it applies in real-world datasets
> How to build a complete ML pipeline — from loading data to making deployable predictions
> Hands-on experience with tools like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn
